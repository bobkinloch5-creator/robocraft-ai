            This Privacy Policy explains how BloxSmith ("BloxSmith", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, stores,
            and shares information when you use our website, Roblox Studio plugin, AI builder, and related services
            (collectively, the "Service"). By using the Service you agree to the practices described below. If you do
            not agree, please stop using the Service.
          </p>
        </header>

        <Section title="1. Who we are">
          <p>
            BloxSmith is an independent AI-assisted development tool for Roblox creators. We are not affiliated with,
            endorsed by, or sponsored by Roblox Corporation. "Roblox" and "Roblox Studio" are trademarks of their
            respective owners and are referenced here only for compatibility purposes.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="2. Information we collect">
          <p>We collect only what we need to operate, secure, and improve the Service:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li><span className="text-foreground font-medium">Account data</span> — email, display name, avatar URL, optional bio, specialization, and authentication identifiers from email/password or Google sign-in.</li>
            <li><span className="text-foreground font-medium">Project data</span> — project names, descriptions, generated scripts, files, prompts, AI conversation history, and metadata you create inside the Service.</li>
            <li><span className="text-foreground font-medium">Studio plugin data</span> — when you install the BloxSmith plugin and connect it to a project, the plugin uploads a structured snapshot of the open Roblox place (instance names, classes, properties, scripts, and hierarchy) so the AI can build with full context. The plugin reads only the place currently open in Studio and only while you are connected.</li>
            <li><span className="text-foreground font-medium">Usage data</span> — credit balances, AI generations, payment requests, MCP server configurations you save, and audit logs of plugin actions.</li>
            <li><span className="text-foreground font-medium">Technical data</span> — IP address, browser/user-agent, device type, and error/diagnostic logs needed to keep the Service reliable.</li>
            <li><span className="text-foreground font-medium">Payment data</span> — when you buy credits we collect a PayPal transaction ID, amount, and pack ID. We do <span className="text-foreground font-medium">not</span> store full payment card numbers — those are handled exclusively by PayPal.</li>
          </ul>
        </Section>

        <Section title="3. How we use your information">
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>To create and manage your account, projects, and credit balance.</li>
            <li>To run AI generations, sync changes to your Roblox Studio session, and execute the actions you queue.</li>
            <li>To process payments, prevent abuse, and detect fraud.</li>
            <li>To send transactional emails (account, security, payment, and support messages).</li>
            <li>To diagnose bugs, monitor reliability, and improve product quality.</li>
            <li>To enforce our Terms of Service and comply with legal obligations.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We do <span className="text-foreground font-medium">not</span> sell or rent your personal data. We do not use your project files or prompts to train third-party foundation models.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="4. AI processing">
          <p>
            When you send a prompt, BloxSmith forwards your prompt, relevant project context, and (when enabled) the
            Studio snapshot to AI providers (currently Groq and, where applicable, the Lovable AI Gateway / Google
            Gemini and OpenAI families) so they can generate a response. Providers may temporarily process this data
            to produce the response and for limited abuse-prevention purposes governed by their own policies. We do
            not authorise providers to train models on your content.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="5. MCP servers and external integrations">
          <p>
            You may optionally connect external Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers (e.g. Notion, Linear, Atlassian)
            or run BloxSmith's MCP endpoint from third-party clients such as VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, or
            Antigravity. When you do, BloxSmith stores the server URL and any authentication header you provide so
            we can call the server on your behalf. You can remove these integrations at any time from Settings.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="6. Legal bases (EEA / UK users)">
          <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we process your personal data on the following bases:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li><span className="text-foreground font-medium">Contract</span> — to provide the Service you signed up for.</li>
            <li><span className="text-foreground font-medium">Legitimate interest</span> — to secure and improve the Service and prevent abuse.</li>
            <li><span className="text-foreground font-medium">Consent</span> — where required (e.g. optional analytics).</li>
            <li><span className="text-foreground font-medium">Legal obligation</span> — to comply with tax, accounting, and law-enforcement requests.</li>
          </ul>
        </Section>

        <Section title="7. Data sharing">
          <p>We share information only with the providers required to run the Service:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>Cloud hosting and database providers (Lovable Cloud / Supabase, Cloudflare Workers).</li>
            <li>AI providers strictly for generating responses to your prompts.</li>
            <li>PayPal for payment processing.</li>
            <li>Email delivery providers for transactional messages.</li>
            <li>Authorities when required by valid legal process.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We may disclose information in connection with a corporate transaction (merger, acquisition, or asset sale). We will give notice before your data becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="8. Data retention">
          <p>
            We keep your account and project data for as long as your account is active. If you delete a project, its
            files and chat history are removed within 30 days. If you delete your account, we remove your personal
            data within 30 days, except for records we must retain for tax, billing, fraud-prevention, or legal
            compliance (typically up to 7 years for financial records).
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="9. Security">
          <p>
            We protect data in transit with TLS and at rest with industry-standard encryption. Database access is
            scoped through row-level security policies so you can only access your own data. Plugin tokens and MCP
            credentials are stored as hashes or in restricted-access tables. No system is perfectly secure — please
            report suspected vulnerabilities to <a className="underline" href="mailto:community100x@gmail.com">community100x@gmail.com</a>.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="10. Your choices and rights">
          <p>Depending on where you live, you may have rights to:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>Access, correct, or export the personal data we hold about you.</li>
            <li>Delete your account and associated personal data.</li>
            <li>Object to or restrict certain processing.</li>
            <li>Withdraw consent at any time (without affecting prior lawful processing).</li>
            <li>Lodge a complaint with your local data-protection authority.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To exercise any of these rights, email <a className="underline" href="mailto:community100x@gmail.com">community100x@gmail.com</a>.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="11. Children">
          <p>
            The Service is not directed to children under 13. Users between 13 and the age of majority in their
            jurisdiction must have parental or guardian consent to use the Service and to make any purchase. If you
            believe a child has provided personal data to us without consent, contact us and we will delete it.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="12. International transfers">
          <p>
            BloxSmith is operated globally and your data may be processed in countries outside your own, including
            the United States and the European Union. Where required, we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses or
            equivalent safeguards.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="13. Cookies and local storage">
          <p>
            We use strictly-necessary cookies and browser local storage to keep you signed in, remember preferences
            (theme, settings, MCP configuration), and run the chat UI. We do not use third-party advertising cookies.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="14. Changes to this policy">
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy as the Service evolves. We will update the "Last updated" date and, for
            material changes, notify you in-product or by email before they take effect.
          </p>
