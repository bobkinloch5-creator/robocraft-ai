            Welcome to BloxSmith. These Terms of Service ("Terms") form a binding agreement between you and BloxSmith
            ("BloxSmith", "we", "us", or "our") and govern your access to and use of our website, AI builder, Roblox
            Studio plugin, MCP endpoint, and any related services (collectively, the "Service"). By creating an
            account, installing the plugin, or otherwise using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not
            agree, do not use the Service.
          </p>
        </header>

        <Section title="1. Eligibility and accounts">
          <p>
            You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service, and old enough to form a binding contract under the
            laws of your country. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you may only use the
            Service with the consent of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms on your
            behalf. You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure and for all activity under your
            account.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="2. Independence from Roblox Corporation">
          <p>
            BloxSmith is an independent tool and is <span className="text-foreground font-medium">not affiliated
            with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or in any way officially connected to Roblox Corporation</span>. "Roblox"
            and "Roblox Studio" are trademarks of their respective owners. You are responsible for ensuring that your
            use of BloxSmith — including any content generated through it and any place you publish to Roblox — also
            complies with Roblox's Terms of Use, Community Standards, and Developer Terms.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="3. The Service">
          <p>
            BloxSmith provides AI-assisted generation of Roblox-compatible scripts, models, and game logic, plus a
            Studio plugin that applies queued changes to a Roblox place you open. Features, models, credit costs, and
            limits may change as the Service evolves. We may add, modify, suspend, or remove features at any time.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="4. Credits, purchases, and refunds">
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>Most AI actions consume credits from your account balance. Credit costs are shown before you spend them.</li>
            <li>You may buy credits through PayPal. Prices are listed on the Pricing page and may be updated from time to time.</li>
            <li>Credits are a limited, non-transferable license to access AI capacity. They have no cash value, cannot be redeemed for cash, and (except where required by law) are non-refundable once spent.</li>
            <li>If a generation fails due to a clear platform error, credits are automatically refunded.</li>
            <li>Suspected fraudulent, chargeback, or abusive transactions may result in immediate suspension and forfeiture of any unspent credits.</li>
          </ul>
        </Section>

        <Section title="5. Acceptable use">
          <p>You agree not to use the Service to:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>Violate any law, regulation, or third-party right (including Roblox's policies).</li>
            <li>Generate or distribute content that is sexual, hateful, harassing, violent, deceptive, malicious, or harmful to minors.</li>
            <li>Build cheats, exploits, malware, account-stealers, or anything that compromises the security of Roblox or other users.</li>
            <li>Reverse-engineer, scrape, or attempt to extract source code, model weights, or non-public prompts beyond what is exposed in the user interface.</li>
            <li>Resell, sublicense, or white-label BloxSmith without our written permission.</li>
            <li>Bypass rate limits, credit checks, or authentication, or share a single account between multiple unrelated users.</li>
            <li>Submit personal data about third parties that you are not authorised to share.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We may remove content, suspend, or terminate accounts that violate these rules, with or without notice.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="6. Your content and licenses">
          <p>
            You retain ownership of the prompts, projects, files, and place data you submit to the Service ("Your
            Content"). You grant BloxSmith a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, process, store,
            display, and transmit Your Content solely as needed to operate, secure, support, and improve the Service
            (including forwarding necessary context to AI providers to generate responses to you).
          </p>
          <p>
            AI-generated output ("Generations") is provided to you as-is. You are responsible for reviewing, testing,
            and adapting Generations before using them in a published Roblox experience. To the extent we have any
            rights in Generations, we assign them to you, subject to (a) your compliance with these Terms, and (b)
            similar Generations that may be produced for other users.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="7. Studio plugin and queued actions">
          <p>
            The BloxSmith plugin runs inside Roblox Studio under your account and applies actions queued by you or
            the AI. You can pause auto-sync, switch to manual-only sync, or disconnect the plugin at any time from
            Settings. You are solely responsible for the contents of any place the plugin modifies — always work on a
            backup before applying experimental changes.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="8. Third-party services and MCP">
          <p>
            The Service integrates with third-party services (Roblox Studio, PayPal, AI providers, MCP servers you
            configure). Your use of those services is governed by their own terms. We are not responsible for the
            availability, accuracy, or behaviour of third-party services or for any data you transmit to them.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="9. Intellectual property">
          <p>
            The BloxSmith name, logo, website, plugin, documentation, and underlying software are owned by us or our
            licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws. Except for the limited rights to use the
            Service granted in these Terms, no rights are transferred to you.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="10. Beta features">
          <p>
            We may label some features as beta, preview, or experimental. Such features are provided on an "as-is"
            basis, may change or be removed without notice, and may consume credits or behave unpredictably. Do not
            rely on beta features for critical workflows.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="11. Termination">
          <p>
            You may stop using the Service and delete your account at any time. We may suspend or terminate your
            access (in whole or in part) if you breach these Terms, if your use creates risk for us or other users,
            or if we are required to do so by law. On termination, your right to use the Service ends immediately;
            sections that by their nature should survive (ownership, disclaimers, liability, indemnity, governing
            law) will survive.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="12. Disclaimers">
          <p className="uppercase text-xs tracking-wider text-foreground">
            The service and all generations are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind,
            whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
            particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, or that Generations will be error-free, compliant with
            Roblox policies, or suitable for publication.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="13. Limitation of liability">
          <p className="uppercase text-xs tracking-wider text-foreground">
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, BloxSmith will not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
            special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenues, data, goodwill,
            or Roblox account standing, arising out of or related to your use of the service. Our total aggregate
            liability for any claim arising out of or related to the service will not exceed the greater of (a) the
            amount you paid to BloxSmith in the 3 months before the claim, or (b) USD $50.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="14. Indemnity">
          <p>
            You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless BloxSmith and its officers, employees, and contractors
            from any claim, demand, loss, or expense (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of (a) Your
            Content, (b) your use of the Service, (c) your violation of these Terms, or (d) your violation of any
            third-party right, including Roblox's policies.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="15. Changes to the Terms">
          <p>
            We may update these Terms from time to time. We will update the "Last updated" date and, for material
            changes, notify you in-product or by email at least 14 days before they take effect. Continued use of the
            Service after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="16. Governing law and disputes">
          <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which BloxSmith is operated, without regard
            to conflict-of-law principles. Disputes will be resolved in the competent courts of that jurisdiction,
            unless mandatory consumer-protection laws of your residence apply. Nothing in these Terms limits any
            non-waivable rights you have under applicable law.
          </p>
