  { q: "How do credits work?", a: "Every action that uses AI costs credits. Chat replies cost 1, script generation 1, system generation 3, full system 5, and a full game scaffold 12. You start with 10 free credits, plus +10 every day and promo codes and buy more whenever you need." },
  { q: "Do you have subscriptions?", a: "No. BloxSmith is credit-only. You buy what you need, when you need it. No recurring charges, ever." },
  { q: "How do I pay?", a: "We accept PayPal. On the checkout page, click the PayPal button to send payment to paypal.me/kinloch930, then paste your PayPal Transaction ID for verification." },
  { q: "How long does verification take?", a: "Usually a few hours. Once an admin confirms your payment in PayPal, credits are added to your account automatically and you'll see them on the dashboard." },
  { q: "What if I don't add the transaction ID?", a: "Credits will not be added until we can match your PayPal payment. Always submit the Transaction ID from your PayPal receipt email." },
  { q: "Do credits expire?", a: "No. Credits never expire." },
  { q: "Can I get a refund?", a: "Credits already spent on AI generations are non-refundable. Unused credits from a purchase can be refunded within 7 days if requested before they're spent." },
  { q: "How does the Roblox Studio plugin work?", a: "Install the BloxSmith plugin in Roblox Studio, paste your plugin token from the Account page, and click Connect. Any file the AI generates on the web is auto-synced into Studio every few seconds." },
  { q: "Can I work with friends?", a: "Yes. Open any project and invite collaborators by email. Changes sync in realtime." },
  { q: "Is BloxSmith affiliated with Roblox?", a: "No. BloxSmith is an independent tool. Roblox and Roblox Studio are trademarks of Roblox Corporation." },
  { q: "What AI model do you use?", a: "We use Google Gemini models through a secure gateway. You don't need any API keys." },
  { q: "Is my code private?", a: "Yes. Your projects are private to you and your invited collaborators." },
